        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="conteiner">
            <p>Good day, everyone,
                <br><br>
                I'm thrilled to share a glimpse of my career transition journey and exploration within the realm of programming. My name is Karinne Kassia, and I hail from Brazil. By profession, I am a lawyer. However, of late, I've chosen to embark on an entirely different path, seeking fresh challenges and opportunities.
                <br><br>
                My journey of discovery commenced during my three-year stint in Argentina. It was there that I first delved deeply into the world of programming. The dynamic and invigorating environment piqued my interest, gradually leading me to realize my desire to further explore this captivating field.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I find myself residing in Ireland, fully immersed in a new culture whilst mastering the English language. This transition has not only facilitated personal growth but has also afforded me the chance to fully embrace my burgeoning passion: programming.
                <br><br>
                Formally, my foray into programming began early last year. It was then that I had the good fortune to cross paths with Professor Gustavo Ganabara, whose profound passion and expertise in the subject left an indelible mark on me. Under his tutelage, I began unraveling the intricacies of this ever-evolving digital landscape.
                <br><br>
                Recognizing the imperative of continuous improvement, I made the decision to invest in my education, enrolling in courses offered by Alura. The abundance of resources and the pragmatic approach of these courses further fueled my passion for programming, propelling me to pursue deeper knowledge.
                <br><br>
                During this intensive learning phase, I arrived at a pivotal juncture: the selection of a programming language to specialize in. This led me to take my initial steps into the realm of Full Stack Python through the EBAC (British School of Creative Arts). This decision not only fortified my learning journey but also provided me with a robust foundation to explore my creative and technical acumen.
                <br><br>
                Presently, I am engrossed in the study of Front-End development, amalgamating my existing knowledge with newly acquired skills. I am delighted to share that I am in the process of crafting my own portfolio, a platform where I can showcase my abilities and envisage future projects. This is merely the inception of an exhilarating journey replete with boundless possibilities.
                <br><br>
                Looking ahead, I aspire to continue broadening my horizons in programming, exploring novel technologies and undertaking challenging projects. I eagerly anticipate the unfolding of this odyssey and am steadfast in my commitment to seize every opportunity that presents itself.
                <br><br>
                I extend my gratitude to each one of you for accompanying me on this voyage and for partaking in this exhilarating moment with me.</p>
